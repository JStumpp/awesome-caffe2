A curated list of awesome Caffe2 experiments, libraries, and projects. Inspired by awesome-machine-learning.

## What is Caffe2?

Caffe2 is Lightweight, Modular, and Scalable Deep Learning Framework. It runs on everything, from cloud to mobile and offers a nice Caffe model zoo with pre-trained models.

More info [here](http://caffe2.ai).

As Caffe2 is very new this curated list is a work in progress...
